### What is Sibernetik?

Rooted in the legacy of Al-Jazari, **Sibernetik** is a modern interpretation of a timeless idea:

> A space where logic meets imagination, and knowledge becomes a shared journey.

We believe in:

*  Collective learning and open collaboration
*  Engineering as both art and science
*  Building tools that blend ethics, elegance, and purpose

Whether you're coding a machine, crafting a system, or simply exploring new ideas - you're contributing to a centuries-old lineage of invention, curiosity, and creative problem-solving.

### 💻 What is Hacking?

> **Hacking is not breaking. It’s understanding deeply, then creating boldly.**

To us, hacking means:

* Taking things apart to learn how they work
* Reimagining systems and bending limitations
* Combining skill with **wonder, play, and purpose**

Just like Al-Jazari’s poetic automata, true hacking is **precise yet playful**, **functional yet fascinating**  - a beautiful form of intelligent rebellion.
